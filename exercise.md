Execrise-2

Modify pipe_lsless.c, make it accept two inputs from command line and pipe them. Your program should run like this./pipe4 [command1] [command2]. You can assume that command1 and command2do not have parameters.

when you run your program as./pipe4 ls less, the result should be the same with runningls | less in shell. If you have installed fortune and cowsay, you may run your program like `./pipe4` fortune cowsay.
